# NZ to Utopia — Policy Document

A collaboratively-edited policy document outlining concrete steps New Zealand can take through the AI revolution — addressing industry transformation, employment transitions, education, and social safety nets.

## About

This isn't about whether AI will transform the economy — it's about what we do about it.

This repository contains the living policy document. It's written in Markdown, version-controlled with Git, and open to contributions from anyone. Every section can be edited, challenged, and improved by the community.
