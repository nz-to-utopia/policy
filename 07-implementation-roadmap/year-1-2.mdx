## Context

The first two years should focus on assessment, planning, and quick wins — actions that build the foundation for larger changes while delivering immediate benefit.

## Key areas to explore

- **National AI assessment** — Commission a comprehensive assessment of AI's impact on NZ industries and workforce
- **Education pilot programmes** — Launch AI literacy pilots in schools and vocational training
- **Regulatory review** — Identify legislation that needs updating for AI
- **Data sovereignty framework** — Establish principles and governance for NZ data sovereignty
- **Transition support pilots** — Trial reskilling programmes in the most affected sectors
- **Public engagement** — National conversation about NZ's AI future

## Questions for contributors

1. What are the highest-priority actions for the first two years?
2. What quick wins could build public confidence in AI governance?
3. What assessment tools and frameworks should NZ adopt?
