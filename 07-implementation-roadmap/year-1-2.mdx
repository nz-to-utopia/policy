## Context

The first two years should focus on assessment, planning, and quick wins — actions that build the foundation for larger changes while delivering immediate benefit.

## Key areas to explore

- **National AI assessment** — Commission a comprehensive assessment of AI's impact on NZ industries and workforce
- **Education pilot programmes** — Launch AI literacy pilots in schools and vocational training
- **Regulatory review** — Identify legislation that needs updating for AI
- **Data sovereignty framework** — Establish principles and governance for NZ data sovereignty
- **Sovereign inference pilot** — Begin scoping and procurement for [government-owned AI inference infrastructure](/transition-strategies/innovation-policy) on open-source models
- **Transition support pilots** — Trial reskilling programmes in the most affected sectors
- **Public engagement** — National conversation about NZ's AI future

## Party canvassing — making AI a political issue

A key Year 1 action: develop a standardised set of AI policy questions covering each major section of this document, and put them to all NZ political parties. Publish responses side-by-side on this site so voters can compare positions.

**Why this matters:**
- Forces parties to articulate concrete positions on AI transition, not vague platitudes
- Creates a public record — stated positions can be tracked against actual policy
- Frames resource allocation as the core question: which parties are willing to invest in transition?
- Relevant to the 2026 NZ election cycle and every cycle after

**The question set** should cover: workforce transition funding, education reform, sovereign infrastructure investment, data sovereignty, social safety net adequacy, and governance frameworks. Responses published as an interactive comparison matrix on the site.
