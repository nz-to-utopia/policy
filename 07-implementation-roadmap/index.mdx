# Implementation Roadmap

<Callout type="draft">
This section is a draft and needs contributors. Help us build a concrete, phased action plan for New Zealand.
</Callout>

## Overview

Policy without a timeline is aspiration. This section breaks down the document's recommendations into concrete, phased actions — what should happen first, what can wait, and what depends on other steps completing.

The roadmap spans from 2026 through 2035, divided into three phases of increasing ambition.

## Sub-sections

- [Year 1–2 (2026–2027)](/implementation-roadmap/year-1-2) — Immediate priorities and quick wins
- [Year 3–5 (2028–2030)](/implementation-roadmap/year-3-5) — Building the infrastructure for transition
- [Year 5–10 (2031–2035)](/implementation-roadmap/year-5-10) — Structural transformation
