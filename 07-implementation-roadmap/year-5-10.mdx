## Context

By 2031, AI's impact will be deeply felt across the economy. This phase focuses on structural changes — fundamentally reshaping how NZ's economy, education system, and social contract work.

## Key areas to explore

- **Economic restructuring** — New industry composition and employment patterns
- **Education system redesign** — Lifelong learning as a permanent feature
- **Social contract** — Evolving the relationship between work, income, and contribution
- **International positioning** — NZ's role in the global AI economy
- **Review and adapt** — Evaluating the roadmap and adjusting for reality

## Questions for contributors

1. What does NZ's economy look like in 2035 under different AI scenarios?
2. What structural changes to the social contract might be needed?
3. How do we build in flexibility for scenarios we can't predict?
