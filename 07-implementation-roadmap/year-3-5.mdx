## Context

By 2028, the initial assessments should be complete and pilot programmes evaluated. This phase scales successful pilots, builds permanent institutions, and begins structural reforms.

## Key areas to explore

- **Scale reskilling programmes** — National rollout of successful transition pilots
- **Education reform** — Curriculum changes based on AI literacy pilot results
- **Regulatory frameworks** — Implement AI governance legislation
- **Income support reform** — Design and trial enhanced safety net programmes
- **Industry transition plans** — Full sector-by-sector transition plans in operation
- **Infrastructure investment** — Computing, connectivity, and data infrastructure

## Questions for contributors

1. What should the success metrics be for the first phase to trigger scaling?
2. Which institutional changes are needed to support permanent transition infrastructure?
3. How do we maintain political will across government terms?
