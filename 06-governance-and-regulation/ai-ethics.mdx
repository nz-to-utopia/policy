## Context

New Zealand needs a coherent ethical framework for AI that reflects our values — including te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations, environmental stewardship, and commitment to equity.

## Key areas to explore

- **Ethical principles** — A NZ-specific AI ethics framework
- **Algorithmic accountability** — Transparency and explainability requirements
- **Bias and fairness** — Preventing AI systems from perpetuating discrimination
- **Employment rights** — Worker protections in AI-managed workplaces
- **Autonomous systems** — Liability and safety for AI decision-making
- **Environmental impact** — Energy and resource costs of AI systems

## Questions for contributors

1. What ethical principles should guide AI use in NZ?
2. How do we make algorithmic accountability practical for businesses?
3. What existing NZ legislation needs updating for AI?
