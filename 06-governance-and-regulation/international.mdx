## Context

AI governance is inherently global. New Zealand can't regulate AI in isolation, but we can be a constructive voice in international frameworks and learn from other countries' approaches.

## Key areas to explore

- **International frameworks** — NZ's engagement with OECD AI Principles, UN processes, etc.
- **Bilateral partnerships** — AI cooperation with Australia, Pacific Islands, and key trading partners
- **Regulatory alignment** — How NZ regulation relates to EU AI Act, US approaches, etc.
- **Pacific leadership** — NZ's role in supporting Pacific nations through AI transitions
- **Trade and AI** — AI provisions in trade agreements and digital economy partnerships

## Questions for contributors

1. Which international AI governance frameworks should NZ align with?
2. How can NZ influence global AI governance given our small size?
3. What obligations do we have to Pacific nations in the AI transition?
