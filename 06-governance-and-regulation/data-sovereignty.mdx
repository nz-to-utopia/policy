# Data Sovereignty

<Callout type="draft">
This section needs contributors, particularly those with expertise in Te Mana Raraunga (Maori data sovereignty). Edit this page to help build it out.
</Callout>

## Context

AI runs on data. Who controls that data — and how it's used — is a fundamental governance question. For New Zealand, this includes both general data rights and the specific obligations of Te Tiriti o Waitangi regarding Maori data.

## Key areas to explore

- **Te Mana Raraunga** — Maori data sovereignty principles and their application to AI
- **National data strategy** — What data should NZ hold sovereign control over?
- **Privacy** — How NZ's Privacy Act applies to AI data collection and use
- **Cross-border data flows** — NZ data in overseas AI systems
- **Government data** — Open data for innovation vs privacy and sovereignty concerns
- **Individual data rights** — Personal control over data used to train AI systems

## Questions for contributors

1. How should Te Mana Raraunga principles be integrated into AI governance?
2. What data should New Zealand not allow to leave the country?
3. How do we balance open data for innovation with sovereignty concerns?
