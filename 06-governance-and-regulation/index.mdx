# Governance & Regulation

<Callout type="draft">
This section is a draft and needs contributors. Help us design governance frameworks fit for AI in Aotearoa.
</Callout>

## Overview

AI governance is one of the defining policy challenges of our time. New Zealand needs regulatory frameworks that protect people and values without stifling beneficial innovation. Our small size is an advantage here — we can move quickly, experiment, and iterate.

A critical dimension: **sovereignty**. If NZ's public services, healthcare, and economic systems depend on AI controlled by foreign governments or corporations, governance is hollow. This section addresses both the regulatory frameworks and the practical infrastructure — including [sovereign inference on open-source models](/transition-strategies/innovation-policy) — needed for genuine self-determination.

## Sub-sections
