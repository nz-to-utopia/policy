# Methodology

## How this document works

NZ to Utopia is a collaboratively-edited policy document hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/nz-to-utopia/policy). It uses Git version control, which means:

- **Every change is tracked** — You can see the full history of edits, who made them, and why
- **Anyone can propose changes** — Via GitHub pull requests
- **Changes are reviewed** — Community members discuss and review proposals before they're merged
- **Nothing is lost** — Previous versions are always accessible

## Document structure

The document is organised into numbered sections, each covering a major policy area. Sections have sub-pages for specific topics. The structure is defined in a manifest file that controls navigation order.

## Status indicators

Each section has a status indicator:

- **Draft** — Initial content that needs significant development and review
- **In review** — Substantive content that is being actively discussed and refined
- **Published** — Content that has been through community review and represents a reasonably stable position

"Published" doesn't mean "finished" — all sections remain open to improvement.

## Contributing

1. **Read** a section that interests you
2. **Click "Edit this page on GitHub"** at the bottom of any page
3. **Propose your changes** — GitHub will guide you through creating a pull request
4. **Discuss** — Community members will review and discuss your proposal
5. **Merge** — Accepted changes are published automatically

For broader discussion, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nz-to-utopia/policy/discussions).

## Principles for contributions

- **Cite sources** — Link to evidence, data, and research where possible
- **Be specific** — Concrete policy suggestions over vague aspirations
- **Consider equity** — How does your proposal affect different communities?
- **Be constructive** — Challenge ideas, not people
- **Respect te ao Maori** — Consider Treaty obligations and Maori perspectives
