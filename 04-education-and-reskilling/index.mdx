## Overview

Education is the single most important long-term lever for navigating the AI transition. We need to prepare young New Zealanders for a fundamentally different economy, while simultaneously helping current workers adapt.

This requires rethinking education at every level — from what we teach children in primary school, through tertiary and vocational training, to lifelong learning systems that don't yet exist at scale.
