## Context

The concept of "education then career" is becoming obsolete. Workers will need to continuously learn and adapt throughout their careers. New Zealand needs infrastructure for lifelong learning that doesn't currently exist at scale.

## Key areas to explore

- **Learning accounts** — Individual training budgets or entitlements for all workers
- **Mid-career reskilling** — Intensive programmes for workers whose roles are displaced
- **Online and flexible learning** — AI-powered personalised learning platforms
- **Employer responsibility** — Obligations and incentives for businesses to upskill staff
- **Community learning** — Libraries, community centres, and local learning hubs
- **Recognition of prior learning** — Credentialing skills gained outside formal education

## Questions for contributors

1. What lifelong learning models have worked well internationally?
2. How do we fund continuous reskilling at national scale?
3. How do we reach workers most at risk who are least likely to self-select into training?
