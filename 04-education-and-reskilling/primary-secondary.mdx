## Context

Today's primary school students will enter a workforce fundamentally shaped by AI. Our curriculum needs to prepare them — not just with technical skills, but with the critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability that will matter most.

## Key areas to explore

- **Curriculum reform** — What should change in the NZ Curriculum for an AI era?
- **AI literacy** — Teaching all students to understand, use, and think critically about AI
- **Computational thinking** — Beyond "learn to code" — systems thinking and problem decomposition
- **Uniquely human skills** — Creativity, empathy, collaboration, and ethical reasoning
- **Teacher preparation** — How to support teachers in using and teaching about AI
- **Equity** — Ensuring all schools, including low-decile and rural, have access to AI education

## Questions for contributors

1. What should AI literacy look like at primary vs secondary level?
2. How do we train teachers who may be unfamiliar with AI themselves?
3. What international models of AI education are most relevant for NZ?
