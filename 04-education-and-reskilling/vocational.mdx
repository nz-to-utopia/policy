## Context

Trades and vocational roles are evolving with AI. Some face automation, while others become more valuable as AI handles routine tasks and skilled practitioners focus on complex, judgment-intensive work.

## Key areas to explore

- **Trades in the AI era** — How construction, electrical, plumbing, and other trades are changing
- **Healthcare vocational training** — AI-augmented nursing, allied health, and aged care roles
- **Te Pukenga reform** — How NZ's vocational education reform can incorporate AI readiness
- **Micro-credentials** — Short, targeted training for specific AI-adjacent skills
- **Apprenticeship models** — Updating apprenticeships for AI-augmented workplaces

## Questions for contributors

1. Which vocational roles are most enhanced (rather than threatened) by AI?
2. How should vocational training change to prepare workers for AI-augmented trades?
3. What micro-credential programmes should NZ develop?
