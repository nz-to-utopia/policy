## Context

Universities, polytechnics, and wananga must adapt both what they teach and how they teach it. AI challenges traditional degree structures, assessment methods, and the very purpose of tertiary education.

## Key areas to explore

- **Degree relevance** — Which degrees are becoming more or less valuable?
- **AI in teaching** — Using AI tools in education while maintaining learning quality
- **Assessment reform** — Rethinking exams and assignments in an AI era
- **Research** — NZ's role in AI research and the funding landscape
- **Industry partnerships** — Connecting tertiary education more tightly to workforce needs
- **Wananga and Maori education** — AI integration that respects kaupapa Maori approaches

## Questions for contributors

1. How should NZ universities change their degree programmes for an AI economy?
2. What assessment methods are robust in an age of AI writing tools?
3. How can NZ punch above its weight in AI research?
