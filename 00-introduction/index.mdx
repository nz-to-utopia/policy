Iain M. Banks in his Culture novels depicted a post scarcity civilisation that we can aim for.

## Why this document exists

Aotearoa New Zealand stands at a pivotal moment. Artificial intelligence is reshaping industries worldwide at a pace that outstrips our policy frameworks, our education systems, and our social safety nets. This isn't a future problem — it's happening now.

New Zealand has unique advantages: a small, cohesive population; strong democratic institutions; a tradition of pragmatic social policy; deep cultural values around community (whanaungatanga) and stewardship (kaitiakitanga). We have the opportunity to navigate the AI transition not as passive recipients of disruption, but as active architects of a better society.

This document is an attempt to chart that course.

## What this is

**NZ to Utopia** is a collaboratively-edited policy document — a living blueprint for how New Zealand can move through the AI revolution toward a more equitable, prosperous, and humane future.

It covers:

- **Economic landscape** — understanding which NZ industries are most exposed to AI disruption, and where the opportunities lie
- **Impact assessment** — honest analysis of job displacement timelines and emerging roles
- **Transition strategies** — sector-by-sector plans for adaptation, not just survival
- **Education & reskilling** — redesigning learning from primary school through lifelong upskilling
- **Social safety nets** — income support, healthcare, housing, and mental health systems fit for a transforming economy
- **Governance & regulation** — AI ethics, data sovereignty (including Maori data sovereignty), and international cooperation
- **Implementation roadmap** — concrete actions phased from 2026 through 2035

## Principles

This document is guided by several core principles:

1. **Evidence-based** — Claims should be supported by data, research, or well-reasoned analysis. We link to sources and welcome challenges.

2. **Concrete** — We favour specific, actionable policy over vague aspiration. "Increase funding for X by Y%" over "invest more in education."

3. **Inclusive** — The AI transition will affect all New Zealanders. This document must consider impacts across demographics, regions, and communities — including tangata whenua, rural populations, and those already marginalised.

4. **Optimistic but honest** — We believe a better future is achievable. We also believe it requires confronting uncomfortable truths about disruption, inequality, and the limits of current systems.

5. **Open** — Anyone can read, contribute, and challenge. The document's history is transparent. Disagreements are worked through in the open.

## A note on scope

This document focuses on **domestic policy for New Zealand**. While we reference international developments and best practices, the goal is a plan tailored to NZ's specific context — our industries, our people, our values.

We don't claim to have all the answers. Many sections are marked as drafts, indicating areas that need more research, more voices, and more debate. That's by design. The document improves through contribution.
