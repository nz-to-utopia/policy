## Context

Government policy plays a critical role in shaping whether AI innovation benefits New Zealand broadly or concentrates wealth and opportunity.

## Key areas to explore

- **R&D incentives** — Tax credits, grants, and funding for NZ AI research
- **Public sector AI** — Government as an early adopter and testbed
- **International partnerships** — Research and trade collaborations on AI
- **Intellectual property** — IP frameworks for AI-generated work in NZ
- **Competition policy** — Preventing AI-driven market concentration
- **Open data** — Government data as a platform for innovation

## Questions for contributors

1. How does NZ's current innovation policy framework need to change for AI?
2. What international innovation policies should NZ consider adopting?
3. How do we balance supporting innovation with managing risks?
