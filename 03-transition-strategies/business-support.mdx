## Context

Most NZ businesses are small to medium enterprises. They need practical support to adopt AI effectively and manage the workforce implications responsibly.

## Key areas to explore

- **AI readiness assessments** — Helping businesses understand their AI opportunity
- **Adoption support** — Grants, advisory services, and training programmes
- **Workforce transition support** — Helping businesses retrain and redeploy staff
- **Ethical AI adoption** — Guidelines for responsible AI use in business
- **Procurement** — Government procurement as a lever for responsible AI adoption

## Questions for contributors

1. What existing NZ business support programmes could be expanded for AI transition?
2. How do we reach small businesses in regional areas?
3. What role should industry associations play?
