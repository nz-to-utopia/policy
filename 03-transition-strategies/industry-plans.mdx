## Context

Each industry faces different AI challenges and opportunities. Generic "adapt to AI" advice isn't enough — we need tailored plans for each major sector.

## Key areas to explore

- **Agriculture transition plan** — From labour-intensive farming to precision agriculture
- **Services transition plan** — Reskilling service workers for AI-augmented roles
- **Creative industries transition plan** — Protecting creative workers while embracing AI tools
- **Tourism transition plan** — Balancing automation with the human touch that visitors value
- **Cross-sector coordination** — How transitions in one industry affect others

## Questions for contributors

1. What industry transition programmes have worked well internationally?
2. How should NZ industry bodies be involved in transition planning?
3. What's the role of unions and worker representatives in sector transitions?
