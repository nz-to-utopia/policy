## Context

Manufacturing in New Zealand is a smaller sector than in many countries, but it remains significant for employment and value-add, particularly in food processing, wood products, and specialised equipment.

## Key areas to explore

- **Food processing** — NZ's largest manufacturing sub-sector, with growing automation
- **Wood and paper products** — Forestry processing and AI-driven quality control
- **Specialised manufacturing** — Niche high-value products where NZ competes globally
- **Robotics adoption** — Current state and barriers to uptake in NZ factories
- **Supply chain** — AI-driven logistics and inventory management

## Questions for contributors

1. What is the current level of automation in NZ manufacturing?
2. Which manufacturing sub-sectors have the most to gain from AI?
3. How do we support manufacturing workers through automation transitions?
