## Context

Tourism was New Zealand's largest export earner before COVID-19 and remains a major employer, particularly in regional areas. The sector faces AI disruption in hospitality operations but also significant opportunities in personalisation and visitor experience.

## Key areas to explore

- **Hospitality automation** — Self-service check-in, robotic cleaning, automated food service
- **Personalised experiences** — AI-driven trip planning and recommendation systems
- **Conservation and tourism** — AI for environmental monitoring and sustainable tourism management
- **Regional impact** — Many tourism-dependent towns have limited alternative employment
- **Marketing and booking** — AI in travel marketing, dynamic pricing, and distribution

## Questions for contributors

1. How is AI currently being used in NZ's tourism sector?
2. Which tourism roles are most at risk?
3. Can AI help make NZ tourism more sustainable?
4. How do we protect regional communities dependent on tourism employment?
