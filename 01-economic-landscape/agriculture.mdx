## Context

Agriculture remains the backbone of New Zealand's export economy. Dairy alone accounts for approximately 25% of export revenue. The sector employs around 150,000 people directly, with many more in related processing and services.

## Key areas to explore

- **Precision agriculture** — How AI-driven sensors, drones, and data analytics are changing farm management
- **Dairy automation** — Robotic milking, herd management AI, and the changing nature of farm work
- **Horticulture** — Automated picking, crop monitoring, and yield optimisation
- **Aquaculture** — AI applications in marine farming and fisheries management
- **Agricultural exports** — Supply chain optimisation and market intelligence
- **Environmental sustainability** — AI for emissions monitoring, water management, and regenerative agriculture
- **Rural employment** — Impact on farm workers, seasonal labour, and rural communities

## Questions for contributors

1. What AI/automation technologies are already deployed on NZ farms?
2. What's the realistic timeline for widespread adoption?
3. How do we support farm workers whose roles change or disappear?
4. Can AI help NZ agriculture become more sustainable while remaining competitive?
