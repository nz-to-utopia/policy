## Context

New Zealand has a world-renowned creative sector — from Weta Workshop and the film industry to music, design, and a growing games industry. Generative AI is fundamentally disrupting creative work, raising questions about authorship, employment, and the value of human creativity.

## Key areas to explore

- **Film and visual effects** — AI tools in post-production, virtual production, and the future of Weta-style work
- **Music** — AI composition, production tools, and impact on NZ musicians
- **Design** — Graphic design, architecture, and industrial design automation
- **Gaming** — AI for procedural generation, testing, and NPC behaviour
- **Writing and media** — AI content generation and its impact on journalism and publishing
- **Maori and Pasifika creative expression** — Protecting indigenous creative practices in an AI era

## Questions for contributors

1. How are NZ creative professionals currently using AI tools?
2. What protections are needed for creative workers displaced by AI?
3. Should NZ develop specific IP/copyright policy around AI-generated content?
4. How do we preserve the value of human creativity and cultural expression?
