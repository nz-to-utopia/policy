## Context

The services sector is New Zealand's largest employer, spanning financial services, professional services, healthcare, education, retail, and government. Many roles in this sector involve routine cognitive tasks that AI can increasingly perform.

## Key areas to explore

- **Financial services** — Banking, insurance, and investment automation
- **Professional services** — Legal, accounting, consulting, and AI augmentation
- **Healthcare services** — AI in diagnosis, treatment planning, and administration
- **Government services** — Automation of public service delivery
- **Retail** — E-commerce, personalisation, and supply chain AI
- **Call centres and customer service** — One of the most immediately disrupted areas

## Questions for contributors

1. Which service roles in NZ are most vulnerable to AI replacement in the next 5 years?
2. Where does AI augment rather than replace service workers?
3. What new service roles are emerging because of AI?
4. How should professional licensing and regulation adapt?
