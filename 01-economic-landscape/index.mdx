## Overview

Understanding New Zealand's current economic composition is essential before we can assess AI's impact. This section maps our key industries, their contribution to GDP and employment, and their exposure to AI-driven transformation.

New Zealand's economy is distinctive: heavily reliant on primary industries (agriculture, forestry, fishing), with a growing technology sector, significant tourism, and a large services sector. Each of these faces different AI-related pressures and opportunities.

## Key questions this section should answer

- What are New Zealand's largest industries by employment and GDP contribution?
- Which sectors are most exposed to automation and AI disruption?
- Where are the growth opportunities that AI creates for NZ specifically?
- How does our geographic isolation and small market size affect the transition?
- What role do Maori-owned enterprises play in the economy, and how might AI affect them?

## Sub-sections

Each industry sector is explored in detail:

- [Agriculture](/economic-landscape/agriculture) — Our largest export earner and a sector ripe for AI-driven efficiency
- [Technology](/economic-landscape/technology) — A growing sector that both drives and is transformed by AI
- [Services](/economic-landscape/services) — The largest employer, facing significant disruption in professional and administrative roles
- [Manufacturing](/economic-landscape/manufacturing) — A smaller sector with high automation potential
- [Tourism](/economic-landscape/tourism) — A major employer vulnerable to AI in hospitality but enhanced by personalisation
- [Creative Industries](/economic-landscape/creative) — Film, music, design, and gaming — deeply affected by generative AI
