## Overview

Understanding New Zealand's current economic composition is essential before we can assess AI's impact. This section maps our key industries, their contribution to GDP and employment, and their exposure to AI-driven transformation.

New Zealand's economy is distinctive: heavily reliant on primary industries (agriculture, forestry, fishing), with a growing technology sector, significant tourism, and a large services sector. Each of these faces different AI-related pressures and opportunities.

### Where NZ earns vs where LLMs hit

The chart below maps each major NZ industry by its share of GDP against its exposure to LLM-based automation specifically — not robotics, not computer vision, but language model disruption. Bubble size reflects the number of people employed in each sector.

The key insight: **the biggest chunk of NZ's economy (services at ~67% GDP) is also the most exposed to LLM automation.** This is the opposite pattern from previous automation waves, which hit manufacturing and agriculture hardest. Meanwhile, NZ's traditional economic backbone — agriculture, construction, primary industries — is among the least affected by LLMs.

This means the jobs that felt "safe" in previous automation waves — office work, professional services, creative roles — are now the vulnerable ones. And the sheer scale of service sector employment means even moderate LLM displacement affects hundreds of thousands of workers.

## Key questions this section should answer

- What are New Zealand's largest industries by employment and GDP contribution?
- Which sectors are most exposed to automation and AI disruption?
- Where are the growth opportunities that AI creates for NZ specifically?
- How does our geographic isolation and small market size affect the transition?
- What role do Maori-owned enterprises play in the economy, and how might AI affect them?

## Sub-sections

Each industry sector is explored in detail:

- [Agriculture](/economic-landscape/agriculture) — Our largest export earner and a sector ripe for AI-driven efficiency
- [Technology](/economic-landscape/technology) — A growing sector that both drives and is transformed by AI
- [Services](/economic-landscape/services) — The largest employer, facing significant disruption in professional and administrative roles
- [Manufacturing](/economic-landscape/manufacturing) — A smaller sector with high automation potential
- [Tourism](/economic-landscape/tourism) — A major employer vulnerable to AI in hospitality but enhanced by personalisation
- [Creative Industries](/economic-landscape/creative) — Film, music, design, and gaming — deeply affected by generative AI
