## Context

Job loss and economic uncertainty have well-documented mental health impacts. Large-scale workforce disruption could strain New Zealand's already stretched mental health services. Proactive support is essential.

## Key areas to explore

- **Psychological impact of displacement** — Evidence on mental health effects of job loss and career disruption
- **Identity and purpose** — When work changes fundamentally, how do people find meaning?
- **AI in mental health** — Chatbot therapy, AI-assisted counselling, and their limitations
- **Prevention** — Designing transition programmes that protect mental health
- **Community resilience** — Strengthening community bonds as a buffer against disruption
- **Youth mental health** — AI's impact on young people entering an uncertain workforce

## Questions for contributors

1. What mental health support should accompany every workforce transition programme?
2. How can AI tools safely supplement (not replace) human mental health support?
3. What community-level interventions build resilience during economic change?
