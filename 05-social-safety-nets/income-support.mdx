## Context

If AI displaces jobs faster than new ones are created — even temporarily — our income support systems must be ready. This ranges from reforms to existing benefits through to more transformative ideas like universal basic income.

## Key areas to explore

- **Current system assessment** — Is NZ's benefit system adequate for large-scale displacement?
- **Universal Basic Income** — Arguments for and against, NZ-specific modelling, implementation options
- **Transition benefits** — Targeted support for workers in actively disrupted sectors
- **Wage subsidies** — Incentivising employers to retain and retrain rather than lay off
- **Taxation** — How to fund enhanced income support (AI productivity taxes, wealth taxes, etc.)
- **International models** — Lessons from Finland's UBI experiment, Singapore's SkillsFuture, etc.

## Questions for contributors

1. What level of income support would be needed if 10% of NZ jobs were displaced over 5 years?
2. Is UBI the right frame, or are targeted interventions more effective?
3. How should income support be funded in an economy where AI concentrates wealth?
