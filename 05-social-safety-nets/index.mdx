## Overview

Even with the best transition strategies, some people will be displaced faster than they can adapt. Our social safety net must be strong enough to catch them — and designed to help them bounce forward, not just survive.

This section examines income support (including the UBI debate), healthcare, housing, and mental health through the lens of AI-driven economic change.

## Sub-sections
