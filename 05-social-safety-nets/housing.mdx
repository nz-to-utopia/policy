## Context

New Zealand's housing affordability crisis intersects with AI-driven economic disruption. Workers who lose income need stable housing; regions that lose industries may see property value collapses; cities attracting AI workers may see further price pressure.

## Key areas to explore

- **Housing stability during transition** — Protecting displaced workers from housing loss
- **Regional impacts** — How AI-driven industry changes affect regional housing markets
- **Construction and AI** — How AI and automation might help address the housing supply crisis
- **Social housing** — Capacity and policy for increased demand
- **Remote work and housing** — AI-enabled remote work changing where people live

## Questions for contributors

1. How do we prevent AI-driven job losses from becoming a housing crisis?
2. Can AI in construction meaningfully increase housing supply in NZ?
3. What housing policies should accompany income support during transitions?
