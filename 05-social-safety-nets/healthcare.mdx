## Context

AI will transform healthcare delivery — from diagnosis to treatment planning to drug discovery. At the same time, economic disruption can create health crises. NZ's public health system needs to adapt on both fronts.

## Key areas to explore

- **AI in diagnosis** — Radiology, pathology, and clinical decision support
- **Rural healthcare** — AI extending specialist care to remote NZ communities
- **Health workforce** — Impact on doctors, nurses, allied health, and support staff
- **Public health** — AI for population health monitoring and preventive care
- **Health equity** — Ensuring AI in health doesn't widen existing disparities
- **Maori health** — Hauora Maori and AI, data sovereignty in health contexts

## Questions for contributors

1. How is AI already being used in NZ's health system?
2. What regulatory frameworks are needed for AI in clinical settings?
3. How do we protect health equity as AI is adopted?
