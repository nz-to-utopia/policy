## Context

AI and automation will not affect all jobs equally. Some roles face near-term displacement, others will be augmented, and some will remain largely unaffected. Understanding these differences is critical for targeted policy.

## Key areas to explore

- **High-risk occupations** — Roles with high routine cognitive or manual task content
- **Sector-specific analysis** — Displacement risk by industry
- **Regional variation** — Areas of NZ most concentrated in vulnerable roles
- **Demographic impact** — How displacement falls across age, ethnicity, and gender
- **International comparisons** — What displacement patterns have emerged in countries ahead of NZ in AI adoption?

## Questions for contributors

1. What NZ-specific data exists on occupational automation risk?
2. Which regions are most vulnerable due to industry concentration?
3. How do we measure "displacement" vs "transformation" of roles?
