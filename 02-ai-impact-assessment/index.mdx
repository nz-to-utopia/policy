# AI Impact Assessment

<Callout type="draft">
This section is a draft and needs contributors. Help us build an honest, evidence-based assessment of AI's impact on New Zealand.
</Callout>

## Overview

This section provides a structured assessment of how AI will affect New Zealand's workforce and economy. Rather than abstract speculation, we aim for concrete analysis grounded in NZ-specific data — backed by interactive visualisations that make the numbers real.

Throughout this section, interactive D3 data visualisations connect to live NZ economic data (Stats NZ, MBIE, OECD) showing unemployment rates, sector employment trends, and AI adoption metrics in real time. The goal is visceral understanding: a graph showing your region's employment concentration in at-risk sectors communicates urgency that paragraphs alone cannot.

## The unemployment threshold test

If AI-driven unemployment reached 12%, or 20%, or 30% — what would you do about it? This interactive tool lets you explore different unemployment scenarios and adjust policy levers to see whether they close the gap. It's a thought experiment designed for honest policy planning: not a prediction, but a stress test.

Adjust the unemployment threshold, then pull the policy levers — tax rates, automation levies, work week reduction, reskilling investment — and watch the outcomes update in real time.

<ThresholdTool />

The tool reveals a critical insight: **no single lever is enough.** Meaningful responses to AI displacement require a combination of revenue generation (taxation), work redistribution (shorter work weeks), and human investment (reskilling). The question for every political party is: at what threshold do you start pulling these levers, and how far are you willing to go?

## Key questions

- Which NZ occupations face the highest displacement risk?
- What new jobs and industries will AI create in New Zealand?
- What's the realistic timeline — what changes in 2 years vs 5 vs 10?
- How does NZ's small market size affect the pace and nature of disruption?

## Sub-sections

- [Job Displacement](/ai-impact-assessment/job-displacement) — Analysis of which roles and sectors face the greatest risk
- [New Opportunities](/ai-impact-assessment/new-opportunities) — Emerging roles, industries, and economic possibilities
- [Timeline](/ai-impact-assessment/timeline) — Phased view of when changes are likely to arrive
