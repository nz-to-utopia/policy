# AI Impact Assessment

<Callout type="draft">
This section is a draft and needs contributors. Help us build an honest, evidence-based assessment of AI's impact on New Zealand.
</Callout>

## Overview

This section provides a structured assessment of how AI will affect New Zealand's workforce and economy. Rather than abstract speculation, we aim for concrete analysis grounded in NZ-specific data.

## Key questions

- Which NZ occupations face the highest displacement risk?
- What new jobs and industries will AI create in New Zealand?
- What's the realistic timeline — what changes in 2 years vs 5 vs 10?
- How does NZ's small market size affect the pace and nature of disruption?

## Sub-sections

- [Job Displacement](/ai-impact-assessment/job-displacement) — Analysis of which roles and sectors face the greatest risk
- [New Opportunities](/ai-impact-assessment/new-opportunities) — Emerging roles, industries, and economic possibilities
- [Timeline](/ai-impact-assessment/timeline) — Phased view of when changes are likely to arrive
