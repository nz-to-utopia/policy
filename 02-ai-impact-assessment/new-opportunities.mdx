## Context

AI doesn't only displace — it creates new industries, roles, and economic possibilities. New Zealand's unique strengths may position us to capture disproportionate benefit in specific areas.

## Key areas to explore

- **AI-enabled industries** — New sectors that only exist because of AI capabilities
- **Augmented roles** — Existing jobs made more productive and valuable with AI
- **NZ competitive advantages** — Areas where our geography, culture, or expertise creates unique AI opportunities
- **Entrepreneurship** — AI-powered startups and small business opportunities
- **Global remote work** — AI tools enabling NZ workers to compete globally from home

## Questions for contributors

1. What new job categories are emerging in NZ because of AI?
2. Where does NZ have a unique advantage in the AI economy?
3. How can we ensure opportunities are accessible across demographics and regions?
